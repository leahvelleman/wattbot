Algorithmically generated poetry in the style of Isaac Watts

This is an experiment in generative poetry with rhyme and meter. Example output can be found on Twitter at @watts_ebooks. 

## Isaac Watts

Watts was probably the greatest author of hymn lyrics in English. (The words to "Joy to the World," 
"Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past" and "This is the Day the Lord Has Made" are all his, and he is the
best-represented poet in *The Sacred Harp.*) 

There are a few things that make him a convenient author to imitate.
- Nearly everything he wrote has a *consistent structure:* four-line rhymed iambic stanzas, mostly Common Meter 
(a.k.a. "things you can sing to the tune of the Gilligan's Island theme song").
- Unlike Emily Dickinson, the most famous user of Common Meter, his scansion and rhyming is *highly regular.*
- He revisits *a small set of images* — mostly Biblical or natural — again and again in his poetry.
- He was *highly prolific,* and everything he wrote is in the public domain and available online.

The consistent rhyme and meter make it easy for a program to scan his poems correctly. His prolific output and
repetitive imagery solves some of the problems with data sparseness that can come up doing this sort of thing
with a limited source corpus.
